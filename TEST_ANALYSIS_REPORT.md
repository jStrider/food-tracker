# FoodTracker Test Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
The FoodTracker project has multiple test failures across both E2E and unit tests. The failures are primarily due to:
1. Configuration issues (Playwright setup)
2. Component testing issues related to authentication implementation
3. Timing and async handling problems

## E2E Test Failures (Critical)

### Issue 1: Playwright Configuration Error
- **Location**: `playwright.config.ts` line 25
- **Error**: Using `require.resolve()` in ES module
- **Impact**: All E2E tests fail to run
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript module system mismatch

### Issue 2: Playwright Version Conflict
- **Affected Files**: All 5 E2E test files
  - `auth.spec.ts`
  - `food-search.spec.ts`
  - `homepage.spec.ts`
  - `meal-management.spec.ts`
  - `nutrition-tracking.spec.ts`
- **Error**: "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here"
- **Root Cause**: Likely multiple versions of @playwright/test or incorrect import

## Unit Test Failures

### Component: CreateMealModal (5 failures)
1. **Multiple Combobox Elements**
   - Tests failing: "displays form fields with defaults", "uses provided default values", "allows selecting meal type"
   - Issue: Finding multiple elements with role="combobox" (meal type selector AND date picker)
   - Solution needed: Use more specific selectors

2. **Date Display Format**
   - Test: "allows changing date"
   - Expected: `2025-07-27` format
   - Actual: `27/07/2025` format
   - Issue: Date format mismatch between test expectation and component display

3. **Form Reset Issue**
   - Test: "resets form when modal is reopened"
   - Issue: Form values not being cleared properly
   - Expected: Empty string, Received: "Test Meal"

### Component: FoodSearch (6 failures)
1. **Meal Selector Content**
   - Test: "renders search input and meal selector"
   - Expected: "Select a meal" placeholder text
   - Actual: Empty content
   - Issue: AuthContext integration affecting component rendering

2. **Loading State Timing**
   - Tests: "shows loading state while searching", "displays error message when search fails"
   - Issue: Loading states not appearing or disappearing too quickly
   - Root cause: Mock timing issues or state updates

3. **Meal Loading**
   - Tests: "loads meals for the selected date", "opens/closes add food modal"
   - Issue: Meals not being loaded from mocked API
   - Error: "Unable to find an element with the text: Breakfast"

### Component: DayView (All tests passing âœ…)
- 10 tests all passing
- Good example of properly mocked authentication and API calls

## Pattern Analysis

### Common Issues:
1. **Authentication Context**: New auth implementation affecting component behavior
2. **Async Timing**: Loading states and API calls not properly awaited
3. **Selector Specificity**: Tests using generic selectors that match multiple elements
4. **Date Formatting**: Inconsistent date format expectations
5. **Mock Data**: Some components not receiving expected mock data

### Successful Patterns (from DayView tests):
- Proper localStorage mocking for auth tokens
- Comprehensive API mocking setup
- Proper use of `waitFor` and `act` for async operations
- Clear test structure and expectations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Fix Playwright configuration to use ES module syntax
2. Resolve Playwright version conflicts
3. Update component tests to handle authentication context
4. Fix selector specificity issues
5. Standardize date format handling

### Testing Strategy:
1. Ensure all tests mock authentication consistently
2. Use more specific selectors (data-testid, aria-label)
3. Improve async handling with proper waitFor patterns
4. Standardize mock data across all tests

## Priority Order:
1. **Critical**: Fix E2E test infrastructure (Playwright issues)
2. **High**: Fix FoodSearch component tests (6 failures)
3. **Medium**: Fix CreateMealModal tests (5 failures)
4. **Low**: Improve test resilience and maintainability
