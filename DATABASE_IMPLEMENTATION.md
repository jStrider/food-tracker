# Database Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Complete TypeORM database layer implementation for the FoodTracker application with robust entity relationships, auto-categorization features, and comprehensive nutrition tracking.

## Implemented Entities

### 1. User Entity (`/backend/src/features/users/entities/user.entity.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Core user management with preferences and calendar relationships
- **Key Features**:
  - User preferences for daily nutrition goals
  - Default meal categorization time ranges
  - Timezone support
  - One-to-many relationship with meals

### 2. Enhanced Meal Entity (`/backend/src/features/meals/entities/meal.entity.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Meal management with intelligent auto-categorization
- **Key Features**:
  - Auto-categorization by time (breakfast: 5-11, lunch: 11-16, dinner: 16-22, snack: other)
  - Manual category override capability
  - User relationship
  - Calculated nutrition totals (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar, sodium)
  - Time-based meal logging support

### 3. Enhanced Food Entity (`/backend/src/features/foods/entities/food.entity.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive food database with OpenFoodFacts integration
- **Key Features**:
  - OpenFoodFacts API integration fields
  - Extended nutritional information (14 nutrients + vitamins/minerals)
  - Local caching system for frequently used foods
  - Sync tracking for data freshness
  - Nutritional quality scoring algorithm
  - Usage tracking for cache optimization
  - Support for allergens, categories, and ingredients

### 4. Enhanced FoodEntry Entity (`/backend/src/features/foods/entities/food-entry.entity.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Junction table between meals and foods with quantity tracking
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculated nutrition values based on quantity
  - Support for all 14+ nutritional components
  - Comprehensive nutrition summary getter
  - Relationship management with meals and foods

### 5. DailyNutrition Entity (`/backend/src/features/nutrition/entities/daily-nutrition.entity.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Daily nutrition tracking and goal management
- **Key Features**:
  - Complete daily nutrition totals (14+ nutrients)
  - Goal tracking with progress percentages
  - Water intake monitoring
  - Exercise calorie tracking
  - Macro ratio calculations
  - Overall nutrition scoring (0-100)
  - Goal achievement status tracking
  - Daily notes support

## Database Relationships

```
User (1) → (M) Meal → (M) FoodEntry → (1) Food
User (1) → (M) DailyNutrition
```

- **User-Meal**: One-to-many with cascade delete
- **Meal-FoodEntry**: One-to-many with cascade delete
- **Food-FoodEntry**: Many-to-one (foods can be reused)
- **User-DailyNutrition**: One-to-many with unique constraint per date

## Advanced Features

### Auto-Categorization System
- Time-based meal categorization with customizable ranges per user
- Override mechanism for manual categorization
- Smart defaults with user preference support

### OpenFoodFacts Integration
- Structured data storage for API responses
- Sync tracking and cache management
- Barcode and name search optimization
- Data freshness monitoring (30-day sync cycle)

### Nutrition Intelligence
- Comprehensive macro and micronutrient tracking
- Quality scoring algorithms for foods and daily intake
- Progress tracking against personalized goals
- Macro ratio calculations and optimization

### Performance Optimization
- Strategic database indexing for common queries
- Composite indexes for barcode searches
- User-date indexes for calendar operations
- Calculated getters for real-time nutrition totals

## Migration System

### Initial Migration (`/backend/src/database/migrations/001-initial-schema.ts`)
- Complete database schema creation
- All table relationships and constraints
- Performance indexes
- SQLite-optimized data types

### TypeORM Configuration (`/backend/src/database/data-source.ts`)
- Production-ready migration system
- Development synchronization support
- Proper foreign key constraints

## Module Integration

### Updated Modules
- **DatabaseModule**: All entities registered
- **UsersModule**: Complete CRUD operations
- **MealsModule**: Enhanced with user relationships
- **NutritionModule**: DailyNutrition entity support
- **AppModule**: Full integration of all modules

### New Service Capabilities
- User preference management
- Meal auto-categorization
- Nutrition goal tracking
- Food cache optimization
- Daily nutrition summaries

## Database Scripts
```bash
npm run db:migrate    # Run migrations
npm run db:generate   # Generate new migration
npm run db:revert     # Revert last migration
npm run db:show       # Show migration status
```

## Type Safety

### Shared Types (`/shared/src/types/index.ts`)
- Complete TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- Enum definitions for categorization
- Extended nutrition tracking types
- Calendar integration types

## Key Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Feature-oriented architecture supports easy expansion
2. **Performance**: Optimized indexes and calculated fields
3. **Intelligence**: Auto-categorization and quality scoring
4. **Integration**: OpenFoodFacts API ready with caching
5. **Flexibility**: User preferences and goal customization
6. **Completeness**: 14+ nutritional components tracked
7. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

## Next Steps

The database layer is now complete and ready for:
1. Service layer business logic implementation
2. API endpoint development
3. Frontend integration
4. OpenFoodFacts API integration
5. MCP server functionality

All entities include comprehensive getters for calculated values, relationship management, and intelligent features like auto-categorization and nutrition scoring.
