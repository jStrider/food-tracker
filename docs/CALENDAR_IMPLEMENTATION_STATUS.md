# Calendar Implementation Status Report

## Overview
The calendar architecture has been successfully redesigned and partially implemented with a modern, scalable approach using React Context, custom hooks, and modular components.

## Completed Components âœ…

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **CalendarContext** (`contexts/CalendarContext.tsx`)
  - Centralized state management for calendar views
  - Date navigation and range calculation
  - Caching mechanism for performance
  - Utility functions for date operations

### 2. Custom Hooks
- **useCalendarNavigation** (`hooks/useCalendarNavigation.ts`)
  - Keyboard shortcuts support (arrow keys, T for today, M/W/D for views)
  - Touch gesture support for mobile
  - URL synchronization
  - Navigation methods (previous/next, go to date, view switching)

- **useCalendarData** (`hooks/useCalendarData.ts`)
  - Smart data fetching with React Query
  - Prefetching for adjacent periods
  - Cache management
  - Statistics calculation

- **useCalendarKeyboard** (`hooks/useCalendarKeyboard.ts`)
  - Keyboard shortcut management
  - Help system (Shift + ?)
  - Customizable shortcuts

### 3. Shared Components
- **CalendarHeader** (`components/shared/CalendarHeader.tsx`)
  - Unified header for all views
  - Navigation controls
  - View switcher integration
  - Add meal button

- **ViewSwitcher** (`components/shared/ViewSwitcher.tsx`)
  - Modern view switching UI
  - Mobile responsive
  - Keyboard accessible

- **DateNavigator** (`components/shared/DateNavigator.tsx`)
  - Date picker for quick navigation
  - Popover implementation

- **CalendarSkeleton** (`components/shared/CalendarSkeleton.tsx`)
  - Loading states for all views
  - Smooth loading experience

### 4. Container Component
- **CalendarContainer** (`components/CalendarContainer.tsx`)
  - Main wrapper with context provider
  - Route handling
  - Error boundaries
  - Loading states

### 5. Month View (Refactored)
- **MonthView** (`components/views/MonthView/`)
  - Modular structure with sub-components
  - **MonthGrid**: Calendar grid with proper date handling
  - **DayCell**: Individual day cells with meal indicators
  - **MonthSummary**: Statistics and overview

## In Progress ðŸš§

### 1. Week View Refactoring
- Need to create modular WeekView components
- Implement better responsive design
- Add swipe gestures

### 2. Day View Refactoring
- Create modular DayView components
- Implement two-column layout improvements
- Add meal timeline view

## Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement virtualization for month grid
- [ ] Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- [ ] Implement service worker for offline support

### 2. Mobile Enhancements
- [ ] Touch gesture support for all views
- [ ] Bottom sheet modals
- [ ] Adaptive layouts
- [ ] PWA features

### 3. Accessibility
- [ ] Complete ARIA labels
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all components
- [ ] Screen reader testing
- [ ] High contrast mode

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all hooks
- [ ] Component testing with React Testing Library
- [ ] E2E tests for navigation flows
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] User guide for calendar features
- [ ] Developer documentation
- [ ] Storybook for components
- [ ] API documentation

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Centralized State**: All calendar state in one place
2. **Reusable Hooks**: Logic separated from UI
3. **Modular Components**: Easy to maintain and test
4. **Performance**: Smart caching and prefetching
5. **Accessibility**: Built-in keyboard support
6. **Mobile First**: Responsive by design

## Next Steps

1. Complete WeekView and DayView refactoring
2. Add comprehensive test coverage
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Create user documentation
5. Deploy and monitor performance

## Technical Decisions

- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Data Fetching**: React Query with smart caching
- **Routing**: React Router with URL sync
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Build**: Vite for fast development
