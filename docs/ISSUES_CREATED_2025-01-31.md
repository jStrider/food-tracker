## Prevention Measures Implemented

### TypeScript Build Error Prevention

1. **Pre-build Check Script** (`frontend/scripts/pre-build-check.sh`)
   - Runs TypeScript compilation check before Docker builds
   - Includes ESLint validation
   - Provides clear error messages

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/pre-build-check.yml`)
   - Automatically runs on PRs and pushes
   - Checks TypeScript compilation
   - Comments on PRs if errors found

3. **NPM Scripts Added**
   - `npm run typecheck` - Quick TypeScript validation
   - `npm run pre-build` - Full pre-build validation

### Fixed TypeScript Errors
- Removed JSX from toast description in useCalendarKeyboard hook
- Created temporary exports for WeekView and DayView
- Fixed unused variables and type mismatches
- Updated MonthView to use calendar hooks

## Summary

- Created 7 new GitHub issues for calendar improvements
- Implemented preventive measures to catch TypeScript errors before Docker builds
- Fixed existing TypeScript compilation errors
- Set up automated checks in CI/CD pipeline

These measures will help prevent build failures and improve the development workflow going forward.
